Possible approaches from here
=============================

Feature-wise improvement
  Parallel requests
  More efficient stores
  More efficient queries

Performance-wise improvement
  Caching etc
  Transparent low-hanging changes to push performance up w/o major changes feature wise
  in-memory implementation
  in-memory file system options for minimal changes

Comparision with existing solutions
  Other KV stores
  Other lightweight general db solutions such as sqlite

Distributed Variant
  One main feature - distributed approach to the same thing
  Store data - sharding/replication etc
  Access data - active-passive; master-master etc

Base reimplementation
  In other languages using specific features:
  1. C - continuous client + binary stores
  2. Python - dict/pickle store
  etc.
  + comparision - performance wise

In product building of simple db
  browser: localstorage + JS
  emacs: text + elisp
  filesystem: files + bash
  etc
